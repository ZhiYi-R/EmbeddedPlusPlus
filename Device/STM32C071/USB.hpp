When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction. 	VALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel.

NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE 	- STALL 	STALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received.

Double-buffered bulk endpoints implement a special transaction flow control, which control the status based upon buffer availability condition (Refer to Section 28.5.3: Double-buffered endpoints and usage in Device mode). 	If the endpoint is defined as isochronous, its status can be only VALID or DISABLED , so that the hardware cannot change the status of the endpoint after a successful transaction.

Host mode 	These bits are the host application controls to start, retry, or abort host transactions driven by the channel. 	These bits also contain information about the device answer to the last IN channel transaction and report the current status of the channel according to the following STATRX table of states: 	-	DISABLE 	DISABLE value is reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a single-buffer channel. When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list. If the aborted transaction was already under execution it is regularly terminated on the USB but the relative VTRX interrupt is not generated. 	-	VALID 	A host channel is actively trying to submit USB transaction to device only when in VALID state.VALID state can be set by software or automatically by hardware on a NAKED channel at the start of a new frame. When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction. 	VALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel is re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled. 	- NAK 	NAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received. When in NAK state the channel is suspended and does not try to transmit. NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE 	- STALL 	STALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received. When in STALL state the channel behaves as disabled. Application must not retry transmission but reset the USB and re-enumerate. */

Double-buffered bulk endpoints implement a special transaction flow control, which control the status based upon buffer availability condition (Refer to Section 28.5.3: Double-buffered endpoints and usage in Device mode).

Host mode 	These bits are the host application controls to start, retry, or abort host transactions driven by the channel. 	These bits also contain information about the device answer to the last IN channel transaction and report the current status of the channel according to the following STATRX table of states: 	-	DISABLE 	DISABLE value is reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a single-buffer channel. When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list. If the aborted transaction was already under execution it is regularly terminated on the USB but the relative VTRX interrupt is not generated. 	-	VALID 	A host channel is actively trying to submit USB transaction to device only when in VALID state.VALID state can be set by software or automatically by hardware on a NAKED channel at the start of a new frame. When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction. 	VALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel is re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled. 	- NAK 	NAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received. When in NAK state the channel is suspended and does not try to transmit. NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE 	- STALL 	STALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received. When in STALL state the channel behaves as disabled. Application must not retry transmission but reset the USB and re-enumerate. */

If the endpoint/channel is using the double-buffering feature this bit is used to support packet buffer swapping too (Refer to Section 28.5.3: Double-buffered endpoints and usage in Device mode). 	If the endpoint/channel is isochronous, this bit is used only to support packet buffer swapping for data transmission since no data toggling is used for this kind of channels/endpoints and only DATA0 packet are transmitted (Refer to Section 28.5.5: Isochronous transfers in Device mode).
